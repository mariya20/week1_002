# Week 1 - Programming Fundamentals

# Conditionals and Loops

## Introduction

Next up on the programming fundamentals section are conditionals and loops. Put plainly, conditionals are choosing whether or not to do something. Loops are doing things multiple times until a conditional is met.

In this application we'll be putting loops and conditionals to the test to create some helpful functions to deal with the stock of books in a bookstore.

## Technology

We'll continue to make use of the Javascript programming language within a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) environment and utilising a test framework called [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) to run our code.

## Instructions

The code structure is exactly the same as your [first steps in programming fundamentals](https://github.com/techreturners/javascript_fundamentals_001) so all the folders and files should already look familiar.

All the running and execution instructions are exactly the same as the previous fundamentals coding tasks.

**NOTE** After cloning this repository you need to `npm install` because we're in a new application code base.

Head on over to [tasks to get started](./docs/TASKS.md).
